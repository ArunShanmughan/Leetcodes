// 162. Find Peak Element

// A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

// Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. 
// If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

// You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is always 
// considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

// You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

var nums = [1,2,3,1];

  var largest = nums[0];
